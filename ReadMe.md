# MP3Tagger
A simple application to change ID3-tags using [Mutagen] (https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen).
Also an exercise for me to practice test-driven development and Python.

## Tests
Unittests enabled through Python's unittest-module.

## Functionality
- Convenient wrapper for Mutagen
- Read files from directory
- Filter for mp3-data
- Get and set title, artist, album, track, year and genre
- Rename files according to their ID3-tags
