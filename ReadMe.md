# MP3Tagger
A simple application to change ID3-Tags using [Mutagen] (https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen).
Also an exercise for me to practice test-driven development and Python.

## Tests
Unittests enabled through Python's unittest-module.

## Functionality
- Read files from directory
- Filter for mp3-data only
